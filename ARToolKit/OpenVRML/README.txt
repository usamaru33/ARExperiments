Readme for OpenVRML-0.14.3-win32
================================

The "src" folder contains the OpenVRML version 0.14.3 source,
patched in order to build cleanly on Windows using the Microsoft Visual
Studio .NET 2003 C++ (version 7.10) compiler.

Users wanting to build OpenVRML for other platforms should use the
original source, obtainable from http://sourceforge.net/projects/openvml.

The "include", "bin" and "lib" folders contain OpenVRML binaries
and libraries.

The "dependencies" folder contains headers and libraries which programs
linking against OpenVRML will also need to include and link against.
