<H1>Notes on the WIN32 port of Henry Spencer REGEX</H1>

<P>See <a href="winregex.html">winregex.html</a>
an description of regular expressions and
why this port was done.

<P>Download <a href="hs_regex.exe">hs_regex.exe</a>
(187k a self-extracting
<a href="http://quest.jpl.nasa.gov/Info-ZIP/">info-zip</a>
archive) to obtain sources, project makefile,
documentation,
precompiled binaries and test program with data.
At runtime of your programs the only required
file is hs_regex.dll.

<OL><LI>The sources were obtained from the C runtime
library section of the FreeBSD.
    <LI>nroff -man | col -bx was run under unix to
	    convert the manual pages to doc files.
    <LI>A regex_test.c main program was written.
	<LI>The microsoft developer studio project was
	    created with test_hs_regex console mode
		application as the main project, and
		hs_regex dynamic link library as subproject.
		Build settings adjusted so that both main
		and subproject outputs go to the same directory.
		The test_hs_regex.exe project source is regex_test.c.
		The hs_regex.dll project sources are
		regexec.c, regcomp.c, regfree.c, regerror.c and
		hs_regex.def.
    <LI>Slight modification to source files,
	limited to changing &lt;regex.h&gt; to "regex.h"
	and adding a definition to utils.h, and inserting
	the __stdcall declaration so that other windows programs
	have a chance of invoking the dll.
	<LI>About a dozen compiler warning are ingored.
	
</OL>
